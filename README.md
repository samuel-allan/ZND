## About
Welcome! ZND stands for Zipped Network Device, or down to earth: A virtual network device which zips every and all requests and downloads through an intermediate high-speed server, thus hugely increasing your (a) speed (b) reducing network usage.

## Release
Q: Great stuff! So when is this comming out?

The test (alpha) version, with a couple of high speed servers in some central locations will be available for use December 31, 2017.

## Can I help support?
Help is most certainly well appreciated (because I am a student and it is already hard to pay for living in the US, let alone upkeeing servers).
